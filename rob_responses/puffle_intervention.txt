{{target}} dropped some of their money while leaving their home. Unfortunately for you, their puffle stole it instead.
You played Aladdin and tried to fetch yourself some amount from {{target}}'s pockets. But, their puffle pulls up the Genie and it's no longer yours.
{{target}}'s street-loving puffle distracted you, LOL.

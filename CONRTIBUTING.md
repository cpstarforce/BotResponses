# Contributing to BotResponse

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **BotResponses**! We appreciate your help in making this project better. By following these guidelines, we can ensure a smooth and organized collaboration.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the repository
First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page. This creates a personal copy of the repository where you can make your changes.

### 2. Create a new branch
Before making any changes, create a new branch. It’s recommended to use a descriptive name for the branch based on the change you're making. For example:

```git
git checkout -b add-new-response
```

### 3. Make your changes
Make the necessary changes to the code or documentation in your forked repository. Ensure that your changes are well-tested and adhere to the style of the existing project. 

### 4. Commit your changes
Once you've made your changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message. This is optional, but good if you would like to add a message. For example:

```git
git commit -m "Create new response"
```

### 5. Push your changes
Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub. Make sure to replace `add-new-response` with the name of the branch you chose earlier:

```git
git push origin add-new-response
```


### 6. Submit a pull request
Go to the **Pull Requests** tab of the original repository and click the "New Pull Request" button. Select your branch and compare it to the base repository. Add a title and description for your pull request to explain the changes you're proposing.

Once submitted, I’ll review your pull request. I may ask for changes or improvements before merging it into the main project.

## Guidelines for Pull Requests

- **Keep it focused**: A pull request should focus on one change or feature at a time. If your change addresses multiple issues, please break it up into separate pull requests.
- **Follow the project’s style**: Ensure that your code follows the style and structure used in the repository (e.g., naming conventions, indentation, etc.). Consistency is key!
- **Testing**: If applicable, add tests to cover your changes. Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- **Documentation**: If your changes involve new features or modifications to existing ones, please update the documentation accordingly.

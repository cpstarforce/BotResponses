# BotResponses

A container for the many creative responses produced by the Star Force bot on Discord. This is a public repository, and anyone, including you, can contribute by adding fresh responses to the lists.

- The list of work responses generated by the bot are included in the `/work_responses/` folder. Each file in this folder contains responses for a specific job.

## Guidelines

- The name or extension of a file must not be changed.
- Each work response must contain the `{{amount}}` variable.
- A work response should not be longer than 300 characters.

## List of variables

Work responses rely on variables to display information. Variables are sorrounded by two curly braces, like `{{variable}}`:

- `{{amount}}` • Returns the amount earned by the user in using the command.
- `{{randomSponsor}}` • Returns the name of a random sponsor.
- `{{randomMascot}}` • Returns the name of a random Club Penguin mascot.
